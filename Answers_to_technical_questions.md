1. How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
- Spent ~ 4.30 hours as I had to install and configure the softwares in my personal machine before writing the test scripts. It took some time to debug some of the config issues. 
- I would have optimized the code in the following areas, if I had time to debug the issues:
	# PageObject model 
	# Hardcoded paths
	# More conditions to validate the TC objectives
2. What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?
- I think Artificial Intelligence(AI) is already creating an evolution in automation in almost all the industries. I guess it's the most trending technology in the coming years.
3. How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?
- I haven't done this before. But, if I had to do it, I would implement the test automation based on following strategy:
	1. First of all, I would discuss with product team and find out the critical/risky areas in the application
	2. Identify all the Regression Testcases(manual) for those areas
	3. Come up with an estimation to automate those testcases
	4. Automate them during the ongoing sprints with 80/20 rule or whatever works with the management and target to complete them by set deadline. 
4. How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?
- Show "Today's deals/offers" on the Home page. I think it is important to attract the customers
- Show suggested/available postal code in the suggestions while user entering the postal code in home page textbox.
- Entering delivery address in the home page (Instead of postal code) would make user to skip entering the same while ordering the food.
- Showing location permission on the home page would help some users to skip entering them while searching for restaurants.
- Showing grid view in the search results is better for the users to view more restaurants in a single page. 
- Showing featured/Top rated restaurants by default in sorting order would help users to make a decision based on the cutsomer ratings.
